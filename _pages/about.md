Hi, I’m Tyler! I work in tech and have a deep passion for all things technology. Whether it’s troubleshooting systems, optimizing workflows, or exploring the latest innovations, I love the ever-evolving nature of the digital world.

Beyond tech, I’m an avid traveler and foodie, always eager to explore new places and flavors. Cooking is one of my creative outlets, and I enjoy experimenting with different cuisines. When I’m not immersed in tech or planning my next adventure, you’ll probably find me unwinding with a good book, a scented candle burning nearby.

Thanks for stopping by!
